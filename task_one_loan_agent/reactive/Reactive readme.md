🔗 reactive/

**Description:** Rule-based reactive agent, no LLM reasoning involved. 
It follows a fixed perceive → decide → act loop: fetch customer data, calculate DTI,
apply a hardcoded threshold rule, and generate a report.
No planning, no memory between calls, no model-driven decisions.

**Run**
cd reactive
python main.py

**Model / Provider:**
- Provider: None
- Model: N/A (deterministic rule-based logic only, no LLM calls)
